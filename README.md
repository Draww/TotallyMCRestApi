# Purpouse
Simplify creating rest api for your Spigot minecraft server.

Basically it allows to create HTTP endpoints for everything you want.

Configuration is simple, plugin is little, and usage is generic.

By default it will embed little HTTP server on port 8888, so you can access endpoints via http://minecraftserverip:8888/endpoint

It supports parameters!


# Installing
